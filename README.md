Summary: s
This is an arena-based action RPG that challenges players to battle through three arenas—Lava, Ice, and Zombies—to earn XP and upgrade their health, speed, strength, and weapons at a central Marketplace. Each arena presents unique enemies and hazards: the Lava Arena features a magma boss that explodes into smaller creatures upon defeat, volcanoes that launch damaging lava projectiles, and lava pits that deal damage if the player falls in; the Ice Arena is home to an ice monster that fires freezing projectiles, alongside slippery ice patches that slow movement; and the Zombie Arena swarms with undead, where players must destroy a spawner to stop them from endlessly respawning while avoiding poisonous attacks that cause lingering damage. Players cannot leave an arena until all enemies (or the zombie spawner) are defeated, and the faster they complete a battle, the more XP they earn. Combat is projectile-based, requiring precise aim and movement to survive.
Once all three arenas have been completed at least once, players unlock the final boss battle—a giant dinosaur lurking within a deadly maze. However, a single cycle through the arenas won't be enough to win; players will need to replay arenas, earn more XP, and upgrade their abilities to stand a real chance. Each time an arena is revisited, enemies become stronger, increasing the difficulty. If the final boss is defeated, the game is won, but if the player dies at any point, all progress is lost, forcing them to start over from the beginning. The game rewards speed, skill, and smart upgrades, challenging players to balance risk and reward as they prepare for their final battle.
